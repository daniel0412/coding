## Classic Backtracing

### common points
- code skeletons for backtracing
```cpp
// recursively call dfs twice w/o current element
// but deduplication is a bit tricker
void dfs(nums, id, path, res){
    // do not include
    dfs(nums, id+1, path, res);
    // do include
    path.push_back(nums[id]);
    dfs(nums, id+1, path, res);
    path.pop_back();
}
// better loop skeleton to add deduplication
// current loop include the element
// next loop pop back to backtrace previous state where the element is not included
// next loop
void dfs(nums, id, path, res) {
    for(int i = id; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        path.push_back(nums[i]);
        dfs(nums, i+1, path, res);
        path.pop_back();
    }
}

// deduplicate
void dfs(nums, id, path, res) {
    for(int i = id; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // obviouse, in the following case, the element is included in the previous stack frame
        if(i > id && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue;
        path.push_back(nums[i]);
        dfs(nums, i+1, path, res);
        path.pop_back();
    }
}
```
