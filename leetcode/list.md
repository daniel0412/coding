## Graph
### Must-knows
- traversal: bfs/dfs
- topological sorting
- shortest path: Dijkstra/Prim's
- A`*` algorithm

classical problems
- cycle detection
- number of connected component
- topological sorting, recover path (for directed graph only)
### Undirected Graph
- add edges for both directions when bulding adjancent list
- remember to break `parent/child` cycle (not a real cycle), erase from data structure, or pass a `pre` variable
- needs to use `visited` set to avoid multiple traversal
- bfs: make use of `degree` vector, but start from degree 1

### problems
- cycle detection
    - all nodes traversal
    - dfs/bfs/uf
- number of connected components
    - all nodes traversal
    - dfs/uf
- union find (only for undirected graph)

### Directed Graph
- add edges for only one direction, but dfs/bfs add in the reverse way
- dfs: most of `directed` graph have multiple connected components, so `visited` would store in/out of path states
- bfs: make use of `degree` vector, and start from 0 degree

#### classical problems
- cycle dectection
    - dfs/bfs
- topological sorting
    - dfs/bfs
- all path from `src` to `dst`
    - dfs (w/o caching/memorization) to rack path
- strongly connected components (SCC)
    - bfs with two passes, one for origial direction order, one for reversed direction order, starting from the same node
    - should start from degree 1 node, if there exists degree 0 node, it cannot be SCC

## Backtracking

### common points
- code skeletons for backtracking
```cpp
// recursively call dfs twice w/o current element, no loop
// but deduplication is a bit tricker
void dfs(nums, id, path, res){
    // do not include
    dfs(nums, id+1, path, res);
    // do include
    path.push_back(nums[id]);
    dfs(nums, id+1, path, res);
    path.pop_back();
}
// better loop skeleton to add deduplication
// current loop include the element
// next loop pop back to backtrack previous state where the element is not included for next loop
void dfs(nums, id, path, res) {
    for(int i = id; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        path.push_back(nums[i]);
        dfs(nums, i+1, path, res);
        path.pop_back();
    }
}

// deduplicate
void dfs(nums, id, path, res) {
    for(int i = id; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // obvious, in the following case, the element is included in the previous stack frame
        if(i > id && nums[i] == nums[i-1]) continue;
        path.push_back(nums[i]);
        dfs(nums, i+1, path, res);
        path.pop_back();
    }
}
```

## Kth problem
- when locating `k`-th, binary first find the solution boundary, and then do binary search in the solution space might help
- in such cases `<k` definitely can move solution; `>=k' is not enough to return the result

## Math
- `prime` number: a `natural number` greater than 1, and cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural number
    - heuristic to check up to `sqrt(n)` + `Sieve of Eratosthenes` to filter
- `composite` number: all `natural` numbers that are not 1 and not `prime` number
- 1 is not a `prime` number, nor is it a `composite` number

## Data Structure Design
- `std::list` is implemented as a `double linked list`, so `prev/next` operation is `O(1)`

## Island Problems
- `pair<int,int>` comparison is defined in stl as `p1.first < p2.first || (!(p1.first > p2.first) && p1.second < p2.second)`
- 'vecotr<int>` comparison is defined to compare each element, if all the same, the one with shorter length is smaller
- transform an image, is to transform all the points in the image (rotate 90/180/270 degrees, leftright/updown reflect)
- given point `(x,y)`, all transforms can results in 8 different representations, pick one as its intrinsic representation

## Sampling

### modulo bias with `rand() % n`
- `rand()` generates uniformly distributed int in the range `[0, RAND_MAX]`
- `RAND_MAX` is library dependent, but usually equals to `32767`
- `rand() % n` is not uniformly distributed, if the modulo is non-zero, i.e., `(RAND_MAX+1) % n != 0`
- it introduces bias toward smaller numbers
- the bias is larger if the range `n` is larger
- to make it uniformly distributed

```cpp
int method1(int mi, int mx) {
    int n = mx - mi + 1;
    double x = RNAD_MAX + 1;
    return (rand() / x) * n + mi;
}

int method2(int mi, int mx) {
    int n = mx - mi + 1;
    int rlimit = RADN_MAX - RAND_MAX % n;

    // ignore random generated number that exceeds the limit
    int x = rand();
    while(true) {
        if(x < rlimit) break;
        x = rand();
    }
    return x % n + mi;
}
```

### reservoir sampling
given online stream of numbers, make sure probably for each number gets selected is the same.
idea: keep the first number, then with probability `1/i` to select the `i-th` number

```cpp
int random(vector<int>& nums) {
    int x = -1;
    for(int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // 1/(i+1) possibility to replace
        if(rand() % (i+1) == 0) {
            x = nums[i];
        }
    }
    return x;
}
```
